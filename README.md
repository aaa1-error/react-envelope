# react-envelope
A few days ago I've stumbled upon react-spring library and wanted to create something nice, hence I created this project.
I used such libraries as __@react-spring/web__, __@react-spring/parallax__ and __Tailwind CSS__

# Running and building
Run in dev mode
```
yarn run dev
```

Build
```
yarn build
```

# Live demo
Firebase: https://react-envelope.web.app/hl (works well) <br>
Vercel: https://react-envelope.vercel.app/ (images load slowly, cuz Vercel limits the speed)
